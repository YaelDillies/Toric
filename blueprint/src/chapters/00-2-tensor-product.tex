  Let $R$ be a domain and $M, N$ two $R$-semimodules.
  If $f$ and $g$ are linearly independent families of points in $M$ and $N$, then $(i, j) \mapsto f i \ox g j$ is a linearly independent family of points in $M \ox N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

  We will prove the equivalent statement:

  Let $P, Q$ be two free $R$ modules, $f : P \to M$ and $g : Q \to N$ be two $R$-linear injective maps.
  Then $f \ox g : P \ox_R Q \to M \ox_R N$ is injective.

  Let $K$ be the field of fractions of $R$.

  The map
  \[ P \ox_R Q \to (K \ox_R P) \ox_R (K \ox_R Q) = (K \ox_R P) \ox_K (K \ox_R Q) \]
  is injective because $R \to K$ is injective and all the modules involved are flat.
  The map
  \[ (K \ox_R P) \ox_K (K \ox_R Q) \to (K \ox_R M) \ox_K (K \ox_R N) \]
  is injective because all the modules involved are $K$-flat (as $K$ is a field).

  $P \ox_R Q \to M \ox_R N$ is now a factor of the composition of the two injections above, and is thus is injective.
\end{proof}
